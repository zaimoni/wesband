Unique to Wesband is the well terrain, which gives no income but heals and cures.
 
If you move to a tile that has no enemies near, your units' movement points will refresh.
 
 
Town
The town is where you start and where you can return to buy and sell items and to hire new henchmen. These shops carry items of quality based on how far in the dungeon the players have been. They will refresh their stock as soon as the players descend a level or clear a level.
 
The Weapon shop is where you can buy and sell weapons.

The Armor shop is where you can buy and sell armor.
 
The Magic shop contains scrolls and potions that may help.
 
The Tavern is where you can hire henchmen.
 
 
Dungeon
Each dungeon floor has one set of stairs up and one down. You can move into the next level any time you wish, but once you descend to a lower level, you will not be able to visit levels higher than that again. Exiting up will always bring you to the town and entering the cavern will always bring you to the last level visited. If you have cleared the last level visited, then entering the cavern will bring you to the level past the last visited.
 
Enemies are placed all throughout the dungeon floors, usually according to a faction. Currently, these are: Cave Creeps, Outlaws, Undead, Orcs, Water, and Planar.
 
As a matter of convenience, once all hostile units have been killed, you will see 'level cleared' above the unit that killed the last enemy, the shroud and fog will then be cleared for all players."

										message=_ "Your Character
Your character is made up of the following: race, alignment (based on race unless human), and character stats. There are no real 'classes' in the Modular RPG Era. Instead, there are templates which set characters on a path. Paths can have restrictions and penalties. A White Mage will not be raising Walking Corpses and a Dark Adept will not have an opportunity to learn the illuminates ability.
 
If in doubt on an issue, remember that the Wesband tries to stay as close to mainline Wesnoth units as possible. If you're wondering why your character cannot cast magic well while wearing armor or why your Troll cannot gain the skirmisher ability, then you should familiarize yourself with Wesnoth mainline a little better.
 
 
Races
 
Humans
Humans are the most versatile race, having characters of all different alignments. They have no bonuses or penalties to gaining attributes and have no race-based weapon adjustments. Humans have the most complex system of magery.
 
Elves
Elves are fleet of foot and dexterous. They have a 2 TP bonus to gaining Deft but a 1 TP penalty to gaining Body. They receive +1 strike when using bows. Their Faerie magic system lends itself well to not using a staff, leaving room for better weaponry. They start out requiring 80% more exp to level.
 
Dwarves
Dwarves are hearty and sturdy but squat. They have a 2 TP bonus to gaining Body but a 1 TP penalty to gaining Deft. They receive +1 strike when using axes and +25% damage when using hammers. They can learn to use Runic magic. They are also good with mechanical instruments, which lets them upgrade thundersticks. They start out requiring 80% more exp to level.
 
Trolls
Trolls are dim and slow but solid as stone. They have a 3 TP bonus to gaining Body but a 2 TP penalty to gaining Deft and Mind. They start out with strong fists and can throw large rocks, but Trolls have a 25% penalty to using any weapon that is not of the bludgeon or lob class. Trolls that train hard to become the shaman of their races can cast a flame attack.  Trolls also have a thick hide that acts like innate armor. They start out requiring 80% more exp to level.

Orcs
Orcs' abilities depend on their standing in Orcish society.  The biggest, toughest, highest ranking orcs have a 1 TP bonus to gaining Body but a 1 TP penalty to gaining Deft - these usually become foot soldiers or leaders.  Middle ranking Orcs have no bonuses or penalties to gaining attributes, and usually become archers or assassins.  The smallest and weakest of an Orcish litter are often mistaken for a separate species, and are known as Goblins.

Goblins
Orcish runts (more commonly known as Goblins), usually find themselves used as cannon fodder.  They have a 2 TP penalty to gaining Body, and a 1 TP penalty to gaining Mind, but start out requiring 30% less exp to level.

Saurians
Saurians are fast and cunning, but frail.  They have a 2 TP bonus to gaining Deft, but a 2 TP penalty to gaining Body.  Their most commonly used weapon is the spear, and their training with it emphasizes speed over strength, giving them +1 strike but -20% to damage with polearms and javelins. Saurians also have scales which act as innate armor. They start out requiring 20% more exp to level.
  
  
Leveling and advancing
Once a character gains their max experience, they go through a sub-level. Each sub-level awards +20% of max hitpoints to current hitpoints, some talentpoints (4TP+level*4), and +1 to max hitpoints. 5 sub-levels awards your character a true level (gaining a true level grants the same benefits as gaining a sublevel, and also cures poison/slowed status).
 
Talentpoints (TP) can be used to upgrade the units attributes or skills. The attributes are Body (strength + vitality), Deft (dexterity and skill) and Mind (mental power and knowledge). Upgrading these cost TP equal to the level the attribute is being upgraded into, with adjustments based on race. That cost is show on the right column of the Upgrade screen.
 
Skills range from gaining weapon skills to introduction into magical orders. All of these have prerequisite attributes, so upgrade your attributes if your desired skill show red.  Many skills also require you to learn other skills first, and in these instances will list the required skills along with their prerequisite attributes. Skills also take TP to gain."

										speaker=narrator
										caption=_ "Weapons"
										message=_ "Weapons have the following attributes: damage, strikes, class, type, attribute requirement, attribute damage bonuses, attribute strike bonuses, spell adjustment and allowance for specials or abilities.
 
Damage is the base damage. This will usually also be the attribute requirement.
 
Strikes are the base number of strikes. This divides lighter weapons and heavier weapons. This difference will be explained in detail below.
 
Class is what weapon skill a character has to have to gain bonuses to this weapon. These include bludgeoning, light blades, heavy blades, polearms, lob, thrown light blades, thrown heavy blades, javelins, bows, crossbows and none (i.e. weapons with non-weapon skills, like thunderstick).
 
Type is a sub-class. For example, Dwarves only get a racial bonus to hammers and not other bludgeoning weapons, so this distinguishes them.
 
Attribute requirements are the minimum attribute a player has to have to deal the full base damage with the weapon. Any shortfall from that decreases the damage by the percent of the shortfall. Weapons that deal damage based on skill, like Saber, require Deft while weapons that mostly require force require Body.
 
Attribute damage bonuses are the percent of an attribute that gets added to the damage of that weapon. 20% Body on a weapon means that a character with 10 Body will gain a 2 point bonus to damage with it.
 
Attribute strike bonuses are the percent of an attribute that gets added to the strikes of that weapon, and is calculalted just like damage bonuses.
 
Spell adjustments are percent numbers that show how much an attack spell will be altered. Staffs are usually the weapon to have this. There are 5 different staff types: Human, Necromantic, Runic (hammers), Faerie (Elvish), and Spirit (Troll, Orcish and Saurian magics all use Spirit).
 
Thundersticks are a special type of weapon. They have no weapon skill associated with them, however they may be upgraded with the Dwarvish skill Thunderstick Tinker. Upgrading a thunderstick with the tinker allows you to either increase damage by 25% or double the strikes while halving the damage. An upgrade raises the thunderstick's level and, while any unit may use a thunderstick, its damage will degrade if the unit using it doesn't have a Thunderstick Tinker skill of at least that thunderstick's level.
 
Allows (ability/special) shows you what abilities or weapon specials are compatible with this weapon. Having the weapon does not necessarily mean that your character can use the ability or weapon special. You character must have the skill first.  Certain abilities and specials cannot be used at the same time, even with a weapon that will allow either to be used.
 
Special note: Weapons have a hidden class based on the number of strikes they have. One group, the generally heavier weapons, has 0 or 1 strike while the other group, the generally lighter weapons, has 2 or more strikes. The heavier weapons have higher attribute damage bonuses while the lighter weapons have higher attribute strike bonuses. Plus, gaining damage via a weapon skill will give 2 points of damage to the heavier group but 1 point to the lighter group."

										message=_ "There is armor for the following locations: torso, head, leg and shield
 
All armor except for shield increases resistances.
 
All armor decreases evade.
 
Torso and leg armor decreases terrain defense.
 
When evade drops below 0, terrain defense isn't affected anymore, but movement points are lost. In the Switch Armor screen, there is a chart to show you how much movement is lost and at what evades extra movement points are lost. 
 
Most armor decreases casting ability, with the exception of robes.
 
Robes restrict a wearer from using head and leg armor, as robes protect those areas as well.
 
Some head armor decreases ranged attack damage.
 
Evade is a skill bonus that effects terrain defense. Each level of evade gives a unit 3% terrain defense, but this value is drastically altered by armor. Normally, armored units can make no use of evade.
 
Shields can recuperate some of the terrain defense lost by wearing armor. The bigger the shield, the more terrain defense gained, but abilities like dual wield or even the ability to have a ranged attack may be lost."

										message=_ "Items
Currently the only non-weapons and non-armors in the game are potions. If a potion's healing value is over 7, it will cure a poisoned unit instead of healing it. Items may be used with right-click commands.
 
 
Magic
Which order of magic a unit belongs to determines its magic attacks. The strength and number of strikes for these attacks is determined by: casting power skill, casting speed skill, the mind attribute, armor worn, and if the unit is wielding that order's version of a mage staff.
 
Casting power increases the damage of the attack(s) by anywhere from 1 to 4 points, depending on the order of magic.
 
Casting speed increases the strikes of the attack(s).
 
Depending on the order of magic, spell damage may have from 10% to 40% of the unit's mind attribute added to it.
 
Armor usually is detrimental to spell damage. Robes are the one exception to this. Certain paths of magic allow a skill which reduces this effect when wielding an appropriate weapon.
 
Wielding a mage staff of that order's type can increase spell damage by the percent listed on the weapon description.
 
 
Non-attack spells
These include illuminates, teleport, bless weapon, heal/cure, plague and soultrap. Some work like attack specials while others may be used with right-click commands. Those that are used with right-click commands also have a mana cost and a casting time. Any spellcaster has a mana capacity equal to their Mind, and casting a spell consumes mana equal to its mana cost. Mana is normally recovered at a rate of 1 per turn, or fully restored when resting. More powerful spells have a higher mana cost. Casting time represents the complexity of a spell. Normally, casting a spell takes a simple action.  If the caster's Casting Speed is high enough (and the spells are simple enough to cast), they can divide up a simple action to cast multiple spells. For example, healing spells have a casting time of 2.  A caster with a casting speed of 3 can cast one healing spell with their simple action and another with their attack action.  If they do so, they will have 2 casting time left over afterwards, allowing them to cast a third healing spell in the same turn.  If their casting speed were 4, they could potentially cast 2 healing spells with their simple action and another 2 with their attack action (assuming they had sufficient mana to do so)."

Up to town/Down into dungeon - on self
These commands allow you to change levels.  They can normally only be used on staircases (or the dungeon entrance), but once a dungeon level has been cleared of monsters they can be used from anywhere within that level.  Once the command has been used, you must end your turn for the action to take effect (this is necessary to prevent multiplayer games from going out of sync). 

Upgrade - on self
This command opens up an option screen where you can spend talentpoints in exchange for attributes and skills.
 
Manage Inventory - on self
This command opens up an series of option screens that let you equip weapons and armor.
 
Get Item - on self while standing on an item
Opens a list of what is on the ground that you can pick up.
 
Drop Item - on an adjacent location
Drop an item. This item must not currently be equipped.
 
Give Item - on an adjacent unit
Gives an item to a unit. The unit may be able to refuse the item, in which case the item is kept.
 
Use on Self - on self
Use an item or spell on yourself.
 
Use on Unit - on an adjacent unit, on a distant unit
Use an item or spell on a unit. The type of item or spell that you can use depends on the distance.
 
Use - on an adjacent location, on a distant location
Use an item or spell on a location. The type of item or spell that you can use depends on the distance.
 
Enter (shop name) - on self while standing on a shop
Enters a shop.
 
Focus on Undead - on an adjacent unit, on a distant unit
Selects which undead minions are your main minions. Non-main undead minions will deteriorate over time. Non-main living units will leave. You can see who is a focused minion by the silver crown overlay.
 
Release Henchman - on an adjacent unit, on a distant unit
Releases a henchman. Will ask for confirmation.
 
Wesband Help - on an adjacent location, on a distant location
Opens this help screen.
 
Note on actions: Players can use a simple action and a complex action once each turn. Attacking counts as a complex action. Using a spell or an items may be complex or simple actions, as indicated by the 'Use' command options. A player may use two simple actions, but the second simple action used counts as a complex action. For example, using two healing potions during a turn will prevent you from being able to attack."

If players are defeated, leaving just one player, this maximum will scale to two upon entering a new map. Undead minions count as henchmen toward this max.
