-various bug fixes



0.2.1
-check and x that syntax error gave (made?)
-spell attack images weren't updating. basically, the units weren't ready to have construct_unit poke the images in yet and they created containers that off-set the list of objects.
-merging era with Wesband to prevent inability for MP campaigns to deal with era correctly.
-changed all initial selection of characters to be done while in the scenario
-located & added missing kusarigama, implosion, aura blast images

-managed to duplicate the weapon issue, will try to find the cause
-fixed display issue with weapon switching
-added in right-click command code for level changing - tested it, and everything seems to work ok, hopefully this will fix the only-host problem,
	also nice because it lets you move onto exit to attack enemy or pick up loot
-split martial focus and faerie touch descriptions into two lines
-latest attempt at fixing sync problem, also made down exit command only show up if there are no fog clearers with canrecruit=yes
-another attempt at sync problem (following right-click command, then end turn pattern), tested on local server
-minor code cleanup, also added side_for to 'you have no items to sell' messages in shops
-added 'Unknown Adventurer' unit ([base_unit] is fog clearer) for character creation purposes
-realized I had overwritten some of your changes, reverted and merged properly
-fixed some character initialization issues (due to omission in re-write of character choice code)
-made an addition at the end of your exit scratch that goes into the "up" code which will probably need to be updated as different types of objects get added. it turns out .length is failing us again. btw, i'm kind of disappointed no dev has noticed the bug report on that yet.
-assigned locked faction on Northerners, as to not confuse players into thinking there is a choice.
-using Fog Clearer for players. maybe a little unnerving to start the game as mud.

-nerfed runic magic by 2 dmg, fixed/updated runic magic description

-wrote in HP for Troll template selection

0.2.0
-symbol_image=well-tile (was Well-tile)
-took out turn_number>1 for turn refresh of actions and rested healing (thought that might have caused the level 1 bug)

-shroud/fog clears when you clear a level of enemies
-giant fixed missing attack frame in giant toxic slime, tharis blademaster
-cleaned up unit saving/restoring on level change to get rid of empty unit type errors
-spent some more time looking for causes of errors
	FS_BATTLETUTOR, ABILITY_MIDDLE_PROTECTION, and ABILITY_REGENERATES_VALUE are used by the Free Saurians
	DIR seems to be coming out of the cyclops eyebeam animations, but I don't see why
		-scratch that, comes from Tharis Master of Darkness line 138, creator probably intended to have directional attack animations then changed their
		mind and went with just one, but forgot to remove direction={DIR} line.
-got the following error during play
	error engine: Formula in WML string cannot be evaluated due to Expected another token
	--> ""
	I caught some of this sort of error when working on unit restoration after level change - it was happening because of attempts to use data
	elements from an array of length 0 (in that case a call to FOREACH on the array).
	Unfortunately, no way to tell what was triggering this particular occurrence.
-fixed Master of Darkness
-added one more inclusion to Wesband_Main.cfg, replaced lost victory_when_enemies_defeated=no line

-added attack icons for troglodyte & troglodyte spawn attacks
-reded costs in stores if cost>gold. might want to do something like this for upgrades at some point, but that might get confusing as TP cost isn't always the issue.
-fix for the dark stone transition to water (took me forever to figure out that transitions are based on nothing other than the terrain letters, that's why it's Rys instead of Cux)
-new terrain: cobble, dark cobble, dark dwarvish stone. none of these have transitions, which is OK if they don't meet each other
-modified terrain occurances and added new occurances
-streamlined terrain randomization

-changed cross mask placement back to a switch statement
-adjusted placement of a couple of gold-drop sounds
-fixed bug that prevented mobs from getting some exp upon spawning.
-fixed level 1 bug lite
-handled action use for equipment change while in dungeon
	-expected behavior: requires attack, allows as many changes to weapons/armor as you like, and only uses attack up if in dungeon and
		equipment after all changes is different from equipment before all changes (so, if you try on a piece of armor, decide you liked your old
		armor better, and change back, it won't cost you anything)
-added variable cleanup to end of equipment change modifications
-changed order of ops on damage/strike bonus from attributes, reduced npc strike modifier from *3 to *2, gave npc damage modifier of *1.25
-minor optimization in create_weapon (transformed while loops into if statements)
-started work on elvish magic, have basic vine attack working
-done w/ forest magic for the moment (vine attack that can be upgraded with entangle and slow weapon specials)
-added faerie touch ability, plus an upgrade (basic ability changes damage modifiers and adds magical, upgrade changes damage type to arcane)
-found another place where elves were using human frames for animations, fixed it
-remembered to give elven commander potential to learn marksman
-corrected talent point cost of grasping vines 1
-fixed attack animation filter on WBD version of goblin impaler

-bug#13: "poking" of attack/special animations not working

remaining bugs:
#6,#8,#9,#10,#11,#13

0.2.0
-moving from Wesband for now. depressed about slowness from having sprites of more than just one race. really depressed about Wesband not working over network
-removed bug#12 (will try to fix later, testing until now hasn't shown any results)
-going to join ModRPG with WesSaga, an open-ended RPG with random plot points
-removed sprite variations based on armor, sprites will only vary based on race and weapon
-removed "club" sprites
-made new sprites for human, elf, dwarf and troll. these are the most fancy/distinct hero-type sprites i could frankenstein (i.e. human is ranger with fencer head, elf is high lord with lord head)
-added starting classes for dwarf: soldier, guardsman, tinker and rune crafter
-added racial bonus/penalties to weapons: number_hard, damage_percent. these are based on one of either 3 weapon dimensions: class, name, user_name
-combined att_modifiers and display_weapon_modifiers into one in attack.cfg, reduced a lot of clutter
-added ranger and trailblazer abilities to mirror terrain movement and defense of human Archer/Ranger tree

-added survivalist, regen based on being in trees, to human ranger line
-added traits healthy (dwarves) and fearless (trolls)

-added a way to degrade thunderstick damage if the user doesn't have the thunderstick skill equal to the thunderstick level, but what i did doesn't work plus it crashes the game. commented out, may want to go with weapon prereq instead (like att prereq). 
-added shield functionality. it lets players regain terrain defense lost by wearing armor.
-gave shield with steadfast capabilities to dwarvish guardsman
-added steadfast ability to dwarves (requires large enough shield)
-booya major bug#12 resolved. turns out it was a bug with wesnoth sending to network players tags in alphabetical order rather than in the original order. fixed in Wesnoth 1.5.7.
-breaking ModRPG from being nested within Wesband (or WesSaga). it might have caused a problem where MP games aren't seen in the lobby.
-put made CONSTRUCT_UNIT an event thanks to new event functionality

remaining bugs:
#6,#8,#9,#10,#11

0.1.24
-fixed bloodlust, still needs icon, may want to limit to polearms, bludgeon and heavy blades (not really possible with current WML)

-temple sells healing potions
-added tome type of usable item, need requirements 
-leadership now affect_allies=yes
-removed darkrobe from humans (frivolous art to add to other races, maybe will reconsider later)
-consolidated human magic/dark magic casting power/speed 
-made dark magic a branch from magic initiate, will need to retool the attack spells to make them make sense
-added artwork and basic framework for male and female elves, handing all the graphics may be way too much for Wesnoth to handle. if this is the case, will take out elves and simply work with humans for now

remaining bugs:
#6,#8,#9,#10,#11,#12

0.1.23
-bug#9: selling can unequip items
-the shop on the overworld refreshes every time you exit the dungeon, gives better equipment depending on how deep the adventurers have gone during the game
-added white_heals spell, available innately to the white order or magic. 
-bug#10: option list of white_heals not displaying correctly, also not showing anything about curing
-added simple_action as variable set from the unit's max_simple_action every side turn
-bug#11: sneak not working quite like it should, unit showing as hidden sometimes when it shouldn't

remaining bugs:
#6,#8,#9,#10,#11,#12

-added rudimentary gold gain from killing
-fixed stat display bugs for armor
-bug#8: cost column has only been displaying 2 characters wide, wrapping to the next line
-"fixed" bug#4, simply triggers when a side in Wesband_Dungeon doesn't reference an existing unit (because I changed Modular_RPG_Human_Wesband to just Modular_RPG_Human)
-likewise, bug#2 is an issue of integrating Modular RPG with Wesband. really considering packaging Mod_RPG with Wesband again, since it will be so much easier at this point
-fixed bug#7, necro staff needed to have name=magestaff
-added ability to sell to shop
-fixed bug#5: dual/triple wield just needed a not_equals=1 instead of equals=0 to test the un-initialized variable special_type.complex
-fixed bug#2: events like post advance put into outside utils file and then called in each scenario. units need to be constructed every time with a macro. 

remaining bugs:
#6,#8

0.1.21

-weapon info shows adjusted values as well as base values, also shows specials

0.1.20
-fixed bug#3, wasn't armor, was weapon_magic_adjust not clearing
-massive changes in handling of weapons and armor. items are now not part of a list where the unit simply holds a number of IDs from the list. instead, items are part of the unit variables and when dropped, sold or given, they get put on the ground. 
-added a bunch of (crappy) ground icons
-created a small item-creating mechanism, will include shops later
-armor info display significantly more sophisticated
-get_item and drop_item commands added
-toying with change to weapon skill cost increase rate. for now the medium/hard increase starts at +3/+5
